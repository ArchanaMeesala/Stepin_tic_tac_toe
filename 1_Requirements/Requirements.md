## **REQUIREMENTS**

## Introduction
In this mini project i have created a TIC TAC TOE game with the help of C language. This game having two options, One,you can play the game along with the computer or you can also play this game along with your friend. 


Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.
The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and COMPUTER).
One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw

## **4 W's and 1 H**

## Who

Anyone who gets stressed and childers during fun hours  can play the game to have some relaxation.

## What

This project is concerned about developing a game which makes us to think logically to win the game.

## When

The children are encouraged to think more logically. They,  naturally develop their logical-mathematical thinking, which can help them in subjects such as math and engineering in the future.

## Why

As this project uses C programming language  it can be easy to understand the logic.

## How

Implemented using Functions , loops and other functionalities of C.

## Basic requirements that very essential are:

* It requires a 3*3 game board and user to give instructions to make a move.
* gcc compiler with a good system.
* Any of the two linux/windows.
* Front end tool : Visual Studio Code.
* Programming Language Used : C
