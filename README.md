# INTRODUCTION
Tic-Tac-Toe Game,where the user can decide to play with the computer(single player mode) or with other user(double player mode).

You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.
The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and COMPUTER).
One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw

# Why build Tic Tac Toe?
I'm sure you're really excited about building the next Facebook or Instagram, but like most things in life, we have to crawl before we walk, and walk before we run---and build Tic Tac Toe before we build large and complex applications.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that flexes the basic concepts in programming. For example, a Tic Tac Toe program requires data structures for storing the board and conditional logic for knowing whose turn it is or if someone has won.

Tic Tac Toe's simple rules are very easy to decompose into small, discrete functions that we can put together to create a complete game. This process of decomposition and synthesis, breaking something down and putting it back together, is absolutely essential to programming.



# RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
